An overview comparing different models on a Mammogram and Iris data set.

Comparisons are made with the following models:
- Decision Trees (including random forests)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Linear and Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks

KNN, SVM and Decision Trees peform best on the low noise Iris Data. 

No clear winner on the comparatively more noisey Mammogram Data shows there is no substitute for clean data!
